# Orangecraft
A simple Minecraft clone in Python made with ursina engine. It has 3 maps (in different .py files): Sandbox, Parkour and Zombie Shooter.<br>
<b>Warning: you must have ursina engine installed to play. If you don't, install it: <a href="https://www.ursinaengine.org/installation.html">link</a>.</b>

## Sandbox
Press LMB to break blocks, RMB to place. Use 1-4 number keys to pick different blocks (1-grass, 2-wood, 3-water, 4-brick).<br>
Fun fact: you can place a lot of blocks at the same position to make your game lag.<br><br>

Fun fact: the gravity here is set to 0.5.<br><br>
