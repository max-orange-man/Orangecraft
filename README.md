## Sandbox
Press LMB to break blocks, RMB to place, 1-4 number keys to pick different blocks (1-grass, 2-wood, 3-water, 4-brick).<br>

Press LMB to shoot. Kill all zombies.<br>
You don’t take damage, and zombies will stop following you if you jump or stand on a brick block.<br>
Fun fact: there’s a shooting sound.<br><br>
