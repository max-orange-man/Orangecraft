A simple Minecraft clone in Python made with ursina engine. It has 3 maps (in different .py files): Sandbox, Parkour and Zombie Shooter.<br>
Thanks to the official ursina engine website for the Minecraft clone and FPS samples (https://www.ursinaengine.org/minecraft_clone.html and https://www.ursinaengine.org/fps.html)<br>
<b>Warning: you must have ursina engine installed to run these scripts. If you don't, install it: https://www.ursinaengine.org/installation.html</b>

## Sandbox

## Parkour
Just jump from one block to another until you reach the big block with noise texture.

## Zombie Shooter
Press left mouse button to shoot. Kill all zombies (you don't take damage).
