# Orangecraft
A simple Minecraft clone in Python made with ursina engine. It has 3 maps (in different .py files): Sandbox, Parkour and Zombie Shooter.<br>
Thanks to the official ursina engine website for the samples (<a href="https://www.ursinaengine.org/samples.html">link</a>).<br>
<b>Warning: you must have ursina engine installed to play. If you don't, install it: <a href="https://www.ursinaengine.org/installation.html">link</a></b>

## Sandbox
Press LMB to break blocks, RMB to place. Use 1-4 number keys to pick different blocks (1-grass, 2-wood, 3-water, 4-brick).<br>
Fun fact: you can place a lot of blocks at the same position to make your game lag.

## Parkour
Just jump from one block to another until you reach the big block with noise texture.<br>
The blocks are randomly generated.<br>
Fun fact: gravity of FirstPersonController here is set to 0.5.

## Zombie Shooter
Press LMB to shoot. Kill all zombies.<br>
You don't take damage from zombies.<br>
Fun fact: there's a shooting sound.
